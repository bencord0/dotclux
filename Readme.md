# Sublime Text 2 Settings
Sublime folder goes in `~/.config` after installing Sublime.
Be sure to `rm -rf ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/JavaScript` first to get
rid of those god awful built in snippets.

Ditto for the Packages/HTML directory.

# Git Config
Execute once and paste resulting key to github

# Node Setup
Execute once (requires sudo)

# Repos Setup
Verify lists are updated, then execute (must be done after node script so that global modules are chowned). Links all my modules to each other using npm link.
